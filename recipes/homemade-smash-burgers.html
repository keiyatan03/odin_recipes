    <h3>DIRECTIONS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Set a cast iron flat-top griddle or large cast iron skillet onto the grill and preheat until smoking.</li><br>
        <li>Spread butter on the inside of the buns and toast on the flat-top until lightly browned. Set aside.</li><br>
        <li>Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each. Do not pack the meat tightly, as this will prevent it from smashing properly. Place each ball on the hot flat-top, cover with a piece of parchment (to prevent sticking to the spatula; re-use each parchment square on a second patty) and immediately smash down to a 1/4 inch thickness using 2 stiff, sturdy spatulas that are criss-crossed to get proper leverage as you press down. You may also use the bottom of small skillet. Sprinkle the meat with salt.</li><br>
        <li>Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the centers are a light pink color. Using a bench scraper or firm spatula, gently scrape up the patties, flip over and immediately cover 4 of them with cheese. Grill an additional 15 to 20 seconds; stack the plain patties over the cheese-covered patties so you have 4 stacks. Move each stack to a bun and serve with your favorite toppings.</li><br>
     </ol>

    <h3>TIPS</h3>
    <p>if you only have one spatula, wrap your other hand in an old dish towel for protection, and use it to press down on the spatula with both hands.</p>
    <p>You can make 4 (4 ounce) patties instead of 8 (2 ounce patties), but I prefer the thinner patties that have more crispy surface area.</p>
    <p>I buy American cheese freshly-sliced from the deli, but individually-wrapped slices will work too.</p>
